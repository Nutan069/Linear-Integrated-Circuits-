Differential amplifier

A differential amplifier is an electronic device used to compare two different electrical signals. 
It has two inputs and gives an output based on the difference between those two signals. 
The main job of this amplifier is to make the difference between the signals bigger so that it can be easily measured or used for other purposes.

A differential amplifier using MOSFETs compares two input signals, Vin1 and Vin2, and amplifies the difference between them. 
The circuit consists of two MOSFETs (M1 and M2), where the sources of both MOSFETs are connected to a common voltage, typically ground or a reference voltage.
The gates of MOSFET M1 and M2 are connected to the input signals Vin1 and Vin2, respectively. 
The drains of both MOSFETs are connected together, and typically a resistor is placed there to help obtain the amplified output.
A current source is also connected to the drains of both MOSFETs to provide a steady current.
The output voltage, which is the amplified difference between Vin1 and Vin2, is taken from the common drain of the MOSFETs.
This setup allows the differential amplifier to amplify the difference in the input signals, providing an output that is sensitive to their variations.

FOUR TYPES OF DIFFERENTIAL PAIR AMPLIFIER: 
Resistor-Loaded Differential Pair: 
*Uses resistors as the drain load.
*Simple design but has low gain due to large  requirements.
*Limited common-mode rejection and output swing.

Current Source-Loaded Differential Pair:
* Replaces Rss with Ideal current source.
* Improves gain.

Simple Current Source Differential Pair:
* Uses a single MOSFET as a current source.
* Gain increases still.

Active Load Differential Pair (MOSFET as Load):
* Both Iss and Rd are replaced with a mosfet .
* Gain is too high.
