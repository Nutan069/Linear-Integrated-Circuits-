Differential amplifier

A differential amplifier is an electronic device used to compare two different electrical signals. 
It has two inputs and gives an output based on the difference between those two signals. 
The main job of this amplifier is to make the difference between the signals bigger so that it can be easily measured or used for other purposes.
